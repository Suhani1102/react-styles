# react-styles
This app is built to learn various ways to style react application.

# 1.Dynamic styles using .css file
We can add styles to our react component by assigning className to elements in component, then providing styles for those classes in .css file.<br/>

# 2. Styled Components
Styled Components is a library for React & React Native to write and manage your CSS.
